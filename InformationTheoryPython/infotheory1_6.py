Summary: Calculates entropy for histogram in Figure 1.6b, which is based on
greyscale values from Figure 1.6a. This image is read in and the number of pixels with each greyscale
are counted.  These frequencies are used to plot a histogram and calculate the entropy.

Produces a graphic with title ending Entropy 7.838 bits
