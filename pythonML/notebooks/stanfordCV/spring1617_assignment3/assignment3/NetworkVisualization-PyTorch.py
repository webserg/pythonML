# # Network Visualization (PyTorch)
# 
# In this notebook we will explore the use of *image gradients* for generating new images.
# 
# When training a model, we define a loss function which measures our current unhappiness with the model's performance; we then use backpropagation to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters, and perform gradient descent on the model parameters to minimize the loss.
# 
# Here we will do something slightly different. We will start from a convolutional neural network model which has been pretrained to perform image classification on the ImageNet dataset. We will use this model to define a loss function which quantifies our current unhappiness with our image, then use backpropagation to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the pixels of the image. We will then keep the model fixed, and perform gradient descent *on the image* to synthesize a new image which minimizes the loss.
# 
# In this notebook we will explore three techniques for image generation:
# 
# 1. **Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps are a quick way to tell which part of the image influenced the classification decision made by the network.
# 2. **Fooling Images**: We can perturb an input image so that it appears the same to humans, but will be misclassified by the pretrained network.
# 3. **Class Visualization**: We can synthesize an image to maximize the classification score of a particular class; this can give us some sense of what the network is looking for when it classifies images of that class.
# 
# This notebook uses **PyTorch**; we have provided another notebook which explores the same concepts in TensorFlow. You only need to complete one of these two notebooks.

# # Pretrained Model
# 
# For all of our image generation experiments, we will start with a convolutional neural network which was pretrained to perform image classification on ImageNet. We can use any model here, but for the purposes of this assignment we will use SqueezeNet [1], which achieves accuracies comparable to AlexNet but with a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity.
# 
# Using SqueezeNet rather than AlexNet or VGG or ResNet means that we can easily perform all image generation experiments on CPU.

# # Saliency Maps
# Using this pretrained model, we will compute class saliency maps as described in Section 3.1 of [2].
# 
# A **saliency map** tells us the degree to which each pixel in the image affects the classification score for that image. To compute it, we compute the gradient of the unnormalized score corresponding to the correct class (which is a scalar) with respect to the pixels of the image. If the image has shape `(3, H, W)` then this gradient will also have shape `(3, H, W)`; for each pixel in the image, this gradient tells us the amount by which the classification score will change if the pixel changes by a small amount. To compute the saliency map, we take the absolute value of this gradient, then take the maximum value over the 3 input channels; the final saliency map thus has shape `(H, W)` and all entries are nonnegative.

# ### Hint: PyTorch `gather` method
# Recall in Assignment 1 you needed to select one element from each row of a matrix; if `s` is an numpy array of shape `(N, C)` and `y` is a numpy array of shape `(N,`) containing integers `0 <= y[i] < C`, then `s[np.arange(N), y]` is a numpy array of shape `(N,)` which selects one element from each element in `s` using the indices in `y`.
# 
# In PyTorch you can perform the same operation using the `gather()` method. If `s` is a PyTorch Tensor or Variable of shape `(N, C)` and `y` is a PyTorch Tensor or Variable of shape `(N,)` containing longs in the range `0 <= y[i] < C`, then
# 
# `s.gather(1, y.view(-1, 1)).squeeze()`
# 
# will be a PyTorch Tensor (or Variable) of shape `(N,)` containing one entry from each row of `s`, selected according to the indices in `y`.
# 
# run the following cell to see an example.
# 
# You can also read the documentation for [the gather method](http://pytorch.org/docs/torch.html#torch.gather)
# and [the squeeze method](http://pytorch.org/docs/torch.html#torch.squeeze).

# # Class visualization
# By starting with a random noise image and performing gradient ascent on a target class, we can generate an image that the network will recognize as the target class. This idea was first presented in [2]; [3] extended this idea by suggesting several regularization techniques that can improve the quality of the generated image.
# 
# Concretely, let $I$ be an image and let $y$ be a target class. Let $s_y(I)$ be the score that a convolutional network assigns to the image $I$ for class $y$; note that these are raw unnormalized scores, not class probabilities. We wish to generate an image $I^*$ that achieves a high score for the class $y$ by solving the problem
# 
# $$
# I^* = \arg\max_I s_y(I) - R(I)
# $$
# 
# where $R$ is a (possibly implicit) regularizer (note the sign of $R(I)$ in the argmax: we want to minimize this regularization term). We can solve this optimization problem using gradient ascent, computing gradients with respect to the generated image. We will use (explicit) L2 regularization of the form
# 
# $$
# R(I) = \lambda \|I\|_2^2
# $$
# 
# **and** implicit regularization as suggested by [3] by periodically blurring the generated image. We can solve this problem using gradient ascent on the generated image.
